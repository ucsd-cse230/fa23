## Description

The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming
language ideas, including high-level programming abstractions, expressive
type systems and program analyses. We will develop these ideas as follows.

1. First, we will see how the *lambda calculus* can be used to
   distill essence of computation into a few powerful constructs,
   and we will use it as a launching pad to study expressive type
   systems, logics and analyses that can make precise predictions
   about run-time behavior at compile time.

2. Second, we will study how this calculus yields
   [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org), a *functional*
   programming language that has been the incubator
   for many recent PL advances. We will use Haskell
   to learn about a variety of high-level programming
   abstractions and techniques.

3. Third, we will learn how functional programming lends itself
   to the *formal verification* of programs, i.e. how to specify
   that code has certain desirable properties, and how to automatically
   verify that those properties are indeed satisfied by the implementation.

For more details see the [lecture](lectures.html) plan.

## Prerequisites

The class is mostly self contained. However, it will be *helpful* to have
some knowledge of basic discrete math, and it will be *essential*
that you enjoy programming and have a desire to learn the material.

## Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](http://www-senate.ucsd.edu/manual/Appendices/app2.htm).

In particular, **all academic work will be done by the student to whom
it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind.** You are expected
to do your own work on all assignments; there are no group projects in
this course.  You may (and are encouraged to) engage in **general**
discussions with your classmates regarding the assignments, but specific
details of a solution, including the solution itself, **must always be your own work**,
but **you may use Copilot/ChatGPT etc. for your programming assignments**.

There will be graded assignments and exam in this course, which will be heavily
based on the assignments. All exams are **closed book**; no tools other than your
brain and a writing instrument are to be used.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously.  In addition to receiving a zero (0) on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties,
up to and including, expulsion from the University.  Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.

## Research

Your class work might be used for research purposes. For example, we may
use anonymized student assignments to design algorithms or build tools to
help programmers. Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the
instructor or TA to do so after final grades have been issued.
**This has no impact on your grade in any manner.**
